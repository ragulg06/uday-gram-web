You are an expert frontend engineer.

I will upload a PDF called **"User Manual of AGY.pdf"**.  
It describes an existing government portal for the Adarsh Gram / PM-AJAY scheme.

⚠ IMPORTANT RULES
- Use the PDF ONLY to understand the workflows, data fields, and user roles.
- DO NOT copy any of its UI design, colors, icons, or wording.
- Build a completely NEW UI and NEW codebase that just supports the same functionality.

========================================
GOAL
========================================
Build a complete admin-style web frontend for a system that:

- Identifies infrastructure, amenities, and service gaps in SC-majority villages.
- Captures village-level and household-level data (Formats I, II, III-A, III-B, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII).
- Prepares and manages Village Development Plans (VDP).
- Tracks real-time progress of infrastructure works and beneficiary-oriented initiatives.
- Generates district and state level reports.
- Supports the Adarsh Gram declaration workflow.

The final output should be a WORKING React frontend (no backend), with routing, pages, components, and mock API calls.

========================================
TECH STACK
========================================
- React (JavaScript, NOT TypeScript)
- React Router for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios (or fetch) with a simple `api` utility that returns mock data
- Component-based architecture with clear folder structure:

  src/
    components/
    pages/
    layout/
    hooks/
    services/
    router/

No build tooling configuration is needed if you generate a Vite or CRA starter, but please show where files should go.

========================================

========================================
AUTH & BASIC PAGES
========================================

1. Login Page
   - Fields: username, password, captcha placeholder.

========================================
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
========================================
- Use Tailwind utility classes to style all pages; keep design simple and consistent.
- Create reusable components:
  - `PageHeader`, `Card`, `StatCard`, `DataTable`, `FormSection`, `FilterBar`, etc.
- Place all dummy data and mock API calls in `src/services/api.js`.
- For now, state management can be local state and simple React Context; use minimal external dependencies.
- Ensure the routing is fully wired so I can navigate the whole app and see all placeholder pages working.

Generate the full React project structure and provide the key code files (App.js, router, layout components, example pages, and Tailwind setup).
Explain briefly how to run the project (npm commands).
